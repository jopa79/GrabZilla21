# This is a placeholder - in a real app, you would need actual PNG icons
# For now, create a simple 512x512 PNG icon for the app
# You can use the SVG logo as a base and convert it to PNG at different sizes:
# - 16x16, 32x32, 48x48, 64x64, 128x128, 256x256, 512x512

# For development, the SVG will work, but for production builds you need:
# - macOS: .icns file (can be generated from PNG)
# - Windows: .ico file (can be generated from PNG)  
# - Linux: .png files at various sizes
