## 🎯 Design Goals

### 1. Zero Context Assumption
Every document assumes reader knows NOTHING about:
- The project's purpose
- Electron architecture
- yt-dlp or ffmpeg
- The codebase structure
- Previous development sessions

### 2. Verification-First Approach
Before diving into code:
1. Verify binaries exist
2. Verify tests pass
3. Verify app launches
4. Build confidence quickly

### 3. Multiple Entry Points
- **5-minute quickstart** - Urgent fixes
- **20-minute comprehensive** - New features
- **60-minute deep dive** - Architecture changes

### 4. Self-Validating
- `verify-project-state.js` ensures docs match reality
- Automated checks prevent documentation drift
- JSON output for programmatic validation

### 5. Practical, Not Theoretical
- Every concept includes code examples
- Step-by-step flows with file references
- Common mistakes highlighted
- Troubleshooting for real problems

```
Status: 🟢 GREEN (Health Score: 94/100)

Binaries:
  yt-dlp:  ✓ 2025.09.26
  ffmpeg:  ✓ 7.1-tessus

Tests:
  Total:     258
  Passing:   256 (99.2%)

## 🚀 Usage Examples

### Example 1: New Agent Onboarding
```bash
# Step 1: Read handoff (15 min)
cat UNIVERSAL_HANDOFF.md

# Step 2: Verify state (30 sec)
node verify-project-state.js

# Step 3: Quick start (5 min)
npm install
npm test
npm run dev

# Total time: 20 minutes to full context
```

### Example 2: Production Debug
```bash
# Quick health check
node verify-project-state.js

# Check output:
# - Binaries OK?
# - Tests passing?
# - App launches?

# If issues found, see UNIVERSAL_HANDOFF.md section "🔍 TROUBLESHOOTING"
```

### Example 3: Feature Implementation
```bash
# Find next task
grep -A 10 "Priority 1" UNIVERSAL_HANDOFF.md

# Understand affected files
grep -A 20 "scripts/services/metadata-service.js" UNIVERSAL_HANDOFF.md

# Implement changes
# ...

# Verify
npm test
node verify-project-state.js
```
